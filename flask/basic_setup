Once you are in the server, let's start with an update and upgrade:

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
Since we'll be using mysql in this series:

sudo apt-get install apache2 mysql-client mysql-server
Once you do that, you'll get the start up page for MySQL, where you will need to set your root user for MySQL. This is the specific MySQL root user, not your server root user.
